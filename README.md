<h2 id="about">What is this?</h2>

In Busy Hour we use [blaze](https://github.com/Busy-Hour-Studio/blaze) as our backend framework where it allow us to write our backend code in an event driven pattern. Unfortunately, as the times goes on it become redundant to recast the result when calling the API through the `context` API. To fix these issues, we create `blaze-types` which automatically generate the type for us so our code will be type safe as much as possible.

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

To get started to use `blaze-types` on your project, you can start by installing it to your [Node](https://nodejs.org/) project by using the following command.

```bash
pnpm i @busy-hour/blaze-types
```

Once you install `blaze-types` in your project, you can start using it by following the complete instruction how to start using blaze-types on your blaze project on our [wiki](https://github.com/Busy-Hour-Studio/blaze-types/wiki) .
